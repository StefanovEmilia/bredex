Create a job search REST API for 4 requests: 

1. POST/client
Register a new client. Required data: name and email (both max 100 characters, and email have to be unique). Response: the API Key (generated by UUID).

2. POST/position
Add a jobpost. Required data: name (the position's name), location and apiKey (name and location max 50 characters, api key have to be valid). 
Response: the URL of the jobpost.

3. GET/position/search
Search jobs with keyword and/or location. 
Required data: keyword (e.g. 'java' - if the position's name is 'java backend developer', 'java' keyword should find it, keyword length: max 50 char),
               location (max 50 char)
Both data could be stay unfilled. In this case the program shows all the job posts. 
Response: URL list with the matched positions

4. GET/position/id
Shows details the job post of the id.


Further Development Opportunities:
New requests: 
- POST/client/edit -> It allows to set their own data after the registration except the apiKey
- POST/client/delete -> Delete a client
- POST/position/edit -> Update a registered position's data
- POST/position/delete -> Delete a job post

Develop current requests: 
- GET/position/search: searching not only the role name and the location, but also a current advertiser's all posts

To run this code you need Java11, and MySQL with Hibernate.
